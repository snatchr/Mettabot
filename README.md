Mettabot is a discord bot that is able to interact with UTMM datastores. You can invite it here: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1203866599262523402&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands

Bot is hosted through discloud and uses ro.py, discord.py and rblxopencloud.

If you haven't noticed yet, the bot is coded in python.

The bot can currently only interact with undertale reseted datastores, however i am in the process of changing that.

Mettabot will always stay open source. I'm kind of new to github and just coding in general, so if you want to give me any suggestions dm me on snatch6129
